 **SETTING THE STAGE FOR WEB 3.0** 
===================================

###### To write about such a diverse and complicated topic as the (future of the web), a few caveats and built-in conditional statements must be made. The purpose of this exploration is to break down the history, current technologies/concepts, and the overall evolution of the internet. Perhaps it can lead us on a logical path of how Web 3.0 will play out while being mindful that trying to predict the future is often a foolhardy errand. 

_Web 1.0_ 

The early internet was an ecosystem where information could be published in a static form of text and images. The information and data were displayed without interaction between the web page and the visitor. It was pre-social media, before platforms, and the monetisation of the internet was still in its infancy.

The content housed on the web could be viewed but not created by users. The protocols associated with this generation were Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 

The HTTP protocol transfers information between a web server and a web browser. The HTML protocol communicates with the browser and informs how to display the text, graphics, and images transferred by the HTTP protocol. 

_Web 2.0_ 

In an effort to clarify the paradigm shift, the main difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 is not only the internet's underlying infrastructure changing but also the ability of consumers to create, share, and interact with content on the web. 

New technological aids made it possible for consumers to create and share content. This led to greater collaboration between consumers, programmers, service providers and organisations, enabling them to repurpose content. 

Web 2.0's applications harness collective intelligence and, in doing so, combine and integrate web content and services to improve the end user's experience. 

This sharing was facilitated via online software with the ability to deliver rich interface experiences on any device or platform without additional software installation.

This culminated with most users using platforms as the internet became largely centralised and platform-based. 

_Web 3.0_

The next iteration, Web 3.0, has been announced for over a decade. Yet, a revolutionary shift in how we experience it, what we can do with it, and how it operates has yet to arrive. Instead, the last ten years resulted in an internet dominated by global "platforms" like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Netflix. 

Even though a continuation of the present trajectory is logical, it seems; that Web 3.0 will be a Web 2.0 that's deeper embedded into more and more things. It is inadvisable to describe all potential Web 3.0 realities, so for the sake of brevity, we will be focusing on Blockchain (crypto-web), Solid (protocol standards), and the Spatial Web (internet of things). 

However, a fundamental question remains "will any of these visions lead to a revolutionary new Internet?" 

**THE CRYPTO WEB**
==================

Blockchain is a de-centralised peer-to-peer (p2p) database incentivised by a token economy, which might enable collaborative scenarios among untrusted parties, i.e. without the governing authority or centralised "platform" that controls and then monetises the data. Almost all cloud providers have implemented elements of blockchain technology.

A majority of what is discussed in media publications concerns the investing and speculation of digital currencies. Our focus is on the most disruptive vision of Web 3.0, the crypto web. 

It is intertwined with the "token economy" built on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and others have risen and fallen and ballooned as an investment asset class which has effectively created parallel financial markets. 

_The user-controlled internet_ 

De-centralisation, a belief that no single entity can take control, is the core tenet of the crypto web. De-centralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) guarantee transparency by aligning the interests of participants through token economies embedded into smart contracts. 

The more successful an app, service or platform is, the higher the token's value, and the more the members will be rewarded—a virtuous cycle whereby only changes that are in the interests of its members get adopted. Through tokens, a DAO is effectively member-owned and governed by community consensus. However, so far, no functioning, stable DAO has emerged.

Writing unchangeable, air-tight, understandable and fair smart contracts is the unyielding problem. Because to do so, the governance structure must encapsulate the entire lifecycle, which remains unsolved. From another viewpoint, you are tasking software developers to hard code the rules (ontologies) for democracy without the ability to write amendments. 

In practice, the problem runs even deeper. The entity that created the app, service or platform also writes the smart contracts that control the creation and distribution of tokens. This means that whoever controls the majority of tokens is the de-facto central controlling authority. Which prompts the question, "why add all this complexity and energy usage, aside from creating a wealth transaction system that no government controls?"  

THE SOLID APPROACH
==================

Social Linked Data (Solid) is best known because of the involvement of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor. This open-source project aims to radically change how web applications function by developing a platform for linked-data applications that are wholly de-centralised and entirely under users' control. 

Solid is essentially a specification, a set of open standards. Personal Online Data Stores (Pods) act as personal web servers that control who and which applications can access data. Solid relies on a standard way of naming and describing data. The underlying structures go back to the Semantic Web, the previous decade's term for Web 3.0. 

Solid envisions a world where applications retrieve and store data in a collection of pods hosted by interchangeable providers. Given that the data is in a standardised format within pods, the user can freely change apps or pod providers and take their data with them.

However, Solid's adoption thus far has been limited. Writing specifications and ontologies that cover the variety of content on the web is laborious, and standardisation is an even slower process. 

In practice, the speed of internet innovation outpaces that of standardisation. Economically speaking, why would a business go to all the trouble—for no financial incentive? 

Nonetheless, two European government initiatives actively investigate Solid as an underlying technology. The governments of Catalonia and Flanders are both working on this. The European Union has laws regarding data privacy (GDPR); potentially, using Solid could be an EU-centric way for governments to store citizens' data.

THE SPATIAL WEB 
================

The Spatial Web is a continuation of Web 2.0, an integration of all ongoing developments: 5G (bandwidth capability), (internet of things), IoT (artificial intelligence/machine learning), AI/ML and (augmented reality/virtual reality), AR/VR.

More devices will come online, sensing and reporting more data, resulting in increased interaction, feeding an information layer so dense and rich that the digital twin and the natural world blend into each other. Hence the Spatial Web and the physical world combine into a 3D spatial environment. 

_The Metaverse_

Facebook's (Meta's) recent claim of the name is a closely related concept: a world of interconnected virtual communities. In this doppelganger universe, you live a virtual life similar to how you live a real life.

It's important to note that the Metaverse is part of the Spatial Web, which seems interwoven with VR/AR as a means of consuming content. This is, however, not a requirement; virtual worlds have existed for years (Second Life, Sims, Fortnite), and virtual communities have existed since the dawn of the internet. The fundamental concept of the Metaverse is interconnectedness. 

Without the free movement of content and data between different communities, the Metaverse would remain siloed and be a series of new platforms with spiced-up content delivery mechanisms. However, a richer, denser, spatial, and possibly 3D-augmented version of Web 2.0 appears to be a likely logical version of Web 3.0. 

**THE MOST PROBABLE OUTCOME**
=============================

A common theme of Web 3.0 is linked with the notion of de-centralisation. For some, “the internet should not be entrusted to a handful of platforms.” De-centralisation is a way to change that, regain control, to re-create a fair and open public internet—a public utility. 

  
_Solid_ 

Solid aims to restore the original vision of the World Wide Web by re-decentralising data. It defines how and where data is stored and accessed but aside from the standardisation effort, it would require international legislation that forces platforms to share valuable data. 

_Crypto Web_

The crypto web enforces de-centralisation by the invisible hand of token economies. Data is de-centralised by design and governed by protocols. It trusts those protocols to be fair and open but has yet to deliver a stable governance model that can withstand the market forces of the underlying token. 

Even if the crypto web does deliver a stable governance protocol, it would still be more complex and costly to run. Therefore it would seem its benefits reside in the grey economy where trust cannot be enforced by traditional laws and contracts.

_Spatial Web_ 

The Spatial Web relies on a free flow of data, without explicitly stating how or why this would come to be besides trust in decentralised and democratic values.

_The Conclusion_ 

It seems that the most likely outcome for Web 3.0 will be quite similar to Web 2.0. A denser, richer version where new platforms emerge, and others fade. While the data flow remains controlled by platforms, monetised and governed by laws and contracts.

**CLOSING STATEMENT** 
======================

The future of the web will continue to be an evolving process. Only time will tell what vision gets adopted, when, and why.
